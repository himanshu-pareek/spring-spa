# Spring Boot + React Application

In this repository, we serve `2` Single Page Applications using a Spring Boot Backend:
1. React Application
2. Vue.js application

But, the approach works for any kind of front-end framework.

## Objective

Create a Spring Boot Application, which serves one or more Single Page Applications.
We want to address the following requirements:
1. Serving one or more SPAs using a single Spring Boot Application ✅
2. Routing should work as expected ✅
3. Protecting SPA using Spring Security ✅
4. Adding different security configuration for different SPAs ✅
5. Accessing backend resources from SPA ✅
6. Configuring CSRF for SPAs ✅
7. Enabling rapid development in watch mode ✅
